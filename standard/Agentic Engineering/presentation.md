## 1. What is Agentic Engineering?

**Agentic Engineering** is the practice of defining goals, constraints, and quality standards for AI agents, who then **autonomously plan, create, test, and refine** software and systems.

Instead of writing every line of code, engineers:

- 🎯 **Design workflows** and specify intentions
- 🤖 **Delegate tasks** to AI agents
- 🔍 **Review and validate** outputs
- 🔄 **Iterate** with structured oversight

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | Agents act with minimal intervention, handling multi-step workflows |
| **Goal-Oriented** | Engineers specify intentions and constraints, not procedural details |
| **Iterative Validation** | Human oversight ensures outputs meet requirements |
| **Collaboration** | Agents coordinate with each other and escalate to humans |
| **Layered Oversight** | Spectrum from suggestion to full workflow execution under supervision |

## 2. The Evolution: Coding → Vibe Coding → Agentic Engineering

The way we build software has been transforming rapidly:

```
2020-2022        2023              2024              2025-2026
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│ Traditional│  │  AI-Assisted  │  │ Vibe Coding  │  │    Agentic        │
│  Coding   │→ │   Coding      │→ │ (Karpathy)   │→ │  Engineering      │
│           │  │  (Copilot)    │  │              │  │                  │
└──────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
  You write     AI suggests       You prompt,       You orchestrate,
  everything    completions       AI generates      agents execute
```

### Key Milestones

- **2021** — GitHub Copilot technical preview (AI autocomplete enters mainstream)
- **2024** — Andrej Karpathy coins **"Vibe Coding"** — "give in to the vibes," accept AI suggestions with minimal scrutiny
- **2025** — Limitations of vibe coding surface — compounded bugs, chaotic codebases
- **2025-2026** — **Agentic Engineering** emerges — from accepting suggestions to orchestrating fleets of AI agents

### Comparison

|               | Traditional Coding | Vibe Coding | Agentic Engineering |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Human Role    | Writes code directly | Prompts AI, accepts output | Orchestrates agents, reviews, manages |
| AI Role       | Suggests/assists | Generates code autonomously | Plans, codes, tests, iterates |
| Oversight     | Full | Partial | Structured, layered |
| Output        | Deterministic | Stochastic, varied | Goal-oriented, quality-controlled |
| Risk          | Human bottleneck | Errors, lack of rigor | Oversight, governance |

## 3. The Four Agentic Design Patterns

Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) identified **four foundational design patterns** that make AI agents far more capable than single-shot prompting:

### 🔁 Pattern 1: Reflection

The agent **critiques, evaluates, and iteratively improves** its own output.

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ Generate  │ →  │ Evaluate  │ →  │  Revise   │ ─── loop until quality met
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

- Code generators that review and debug their own code
- Even simpler models, when used with reflection, **outperform advanced models** used without it

### 🔧 Pattern 2: Tool Use

Agents access **external tools** — APIs, databases, web search, code execution — extending beyond the LLM's built-in knowledge.

- Research agents that search the web for up-to-date information
- Agents that execute code, query databases, or interact with business software

### 📋 Pattern 3: Planning

Decompose a complex problem into a **sequence of actionable steps**, then execute them — adjusting dynamically as new information emerges.

- Break a project into: requirements → design → implementation → testing
- Dynamic replanning when intermediate steps fail

### 👥 Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration

Distribute tasks among **multiple specialized agents** that interact, debate, critique, and combine their efforts.

- "Planner" + "Coder" + "Reviewer" + "Integrator" agent teams
- Debate systems where agents argue opposing sides to reach consensus

## 4. Agent Architecture: How Agents Work

At their core, AI agents follow a **Perceive → Plan → Act → Reflect** loop:

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
        │          Agent Core Loop             │
        │                                     │
        │   ┌──────────┐                      │
        │   │ Perceive  │ ← Context, tools,   │
        │   └─────┬─────┘   user input        │
        │         ▼                            │
        │   ┌──────────┐                      │
        │   │   Plan    │ ← Decompose goals   │
        │   └─────┬─────┘   into steps        │
        │         ▼                            │
        │   ┌──────────┐                      │
        │   │   Act     │ ← Execute tools,    │
        │   └─────┬─────┘   generate output   │
        │         ▼                            │
        │   ┌──────────┐                      │
        │   │ Reflect   │ ← Evaluate results, │
        │   └─────┬─────┘   improve           │
        │         │                            │
        │         └────── loop ────────────────┘
        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Memory Systems

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Short-term (Working)** | Current task context | Conversation history, current plan |
| **Long-term (Persistent)** | Knowledge across sessions | Embeddings, vector stores, learned preferences |
| **Episodic** | Past experiences | Previous task outcomes, error patterns |

### Key Principle: Bounded Autonomy

Agents are **not fully autonomous**. They operate within defined boundaries:

- What tools they can use
- What actions require human approval
- When to escalate vs. proceed independently

> 📖 Ref: [Google Cloud — "What is Agentic AI?"](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-agentic-ai) · [arxiv — "Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06216)

## 5. Agentic Coding Tools Landscape

The tools we use to write software are becoming **agentic** — moving from autocomplete to autonomous coding:

| Tool | Best For | Standout Feature | Autonomy |
|------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **GitHub Copilot Agent** | Teams, compliance | Tightest IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains) | High |
| **Cursor** | Complex projects | Multi-file refactor, AI-native IDE | High |
| **Windsurf** | Enterprises | Cascade engine, auto linter fixes | High |
| **Claude Code** | DevOps, CLI users | Deep code reasoning, terminal-based | High |
| **Devin** | Full automation | End-to-end autonomous engineer | Very High |
| **OpenAI Codex** | CLI power-users | Multi-modal CLI, open models | Moderate |

### What Makes Them "Agentic"?

Unlike traditional autocomplete, these tools can:

- ✅ **Plan** multi-step changes across files
- ✅ **Execute** code, run tests, read errors
- ✅ **Iterate** — fix their own mistakes based on test/lint output
- ✅ **Use tools** — terminal, browser, file system
- ✅ **Reflect** — evaluate their output and improve it

---

## 6. Agentic Frameworks for Developers

Four major frameworks dominate the agentic AI space:

### LangGraph (LangChain)

- **Graph-based state machine** architecture for stateful, cyclical workflows
- Enterprise-ready: error handling, checkpointing, durable execution
- Used by Klarna, Uber, Replit
- ⚠️ Steep learning curve

### AutoGen (Microsoft)

- **Conversation-driven** multi-agent system
- Agents delegate tasks and communicate through dialogue
- Great for rapid prototyping of multi-agent capabilities

### CrewAI

- **Role-based team** paradigm — each agent specializes in a skill
- Centralized task delegation and coordination
- Lower token usage and latency in benchmarks

### Semantic Kernel (Microsoft)

- **Plugin/skill architecture** for enterprise integration
- Composable connectors for existing APIs and business processes
- Production-grade orchestration, logging, monitoring

### Comparison

| Framework | Architecture | Best For | Learning Curve |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **LangGraph** | Graph-based state machines | Production, complex workflows | Steep |
| **AutoGen** | Conversation-driven | Multi-agent prototyping | Moderate |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based teams | Structured collaboration | Easy |
| **Semantic Kernel** | Plugin/skill-based | Enterprise integration | Moderate |

---

## 7. The Protocols: MCP and A2A

Two open protocols are standardizing how agents connect to the world and to each other:

### MCP — Model Context Protocol (Anthropic, Nov 2024)

> "The USB port for AI" — a universal way for LLMs to connect to external data, tools, and services.

```
┌─────────────┐     JSON-RPC 2.0     ┌─────────────┐
│  AI Client   │ ◄──────────────────► │  MCP Server  │
│ (Claude, etc)│                      │ (Tools/Data) │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘
```

- **Resources** — structured data (documents, DB rows)
- **Tools** — executable functions (APIs, scripts)
- **Prompts** — workflow templates
- Inspired by the **Language Server Protocol** (LSP)
- Adopted by OpenAI, Google DeepMind; donated to the **Linux Foundation**

### A2A — Agent-to-Agent Protocol (Google, 2025)

> Enables secure, interoperable communication **between agents**, regardless of vendor or framework.

```
┌─────────────┐     A2A Protocol      ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent A    │ ◄──────────────────► │   Agent B    │
│ (Any vendor) │                      │ (Any vendor) │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘
```

- **Agent Cards** — JSON capability manifests at well-known endpoints
- **Tasks** — formal lifecycle: submitted → working → completed/failed
- **Opaque execution** — agents don't expose internal state
- 150+ partners; governed by the **Linux Foundation**

### MCP vs A2A — Complementary, Not Competing

| Aspect | MCP | A2A |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Focus** | Agent ↔ Tools/Data | Agent ↔ Agent |
| **Purpose** | Give an agent access to external capabilities | Let agents collaborate across boundaries |
| **Analogy** | USB port (connect peripherals) | Network protocol (connect computers) |
| **Together** | MCP enriches each agent's capabilities; A2A lets those agents collaborate |

## 8. Best Practices for Agentic Engineering

### 🔒 Identity & Scope

- Treat each agent as a **distinct, non-human principal**
- Assign narrow, well-defined roles and permissions
- Avoid over-privileged service accounts

### 🎯 Bounded Autonomy

- Limit actions agents can take **without human approval**
- Especially for high-risk or business-impacting operations
- Implement logging and rationale-tracking for significant actions

### 👁️ Observability & Traceability

- Embed robust monitoring to track agent actions and outputs
- Maintain **full audit logs** for investigation and improvement
- Know what your agents are doing at all times

### 🛡️ Policy Enforcement at Boundaries

- Shift from "prompt engineering" to **hard controls** at boundaries
- Where agents interact with identities, tools, data, and output
- Regularly review and enforce boundary policies

### 👤 Human-in-the-Loop

- For high-stakes or regulated domains, **maintain human oversight**
- The EU AI Act may mandate human oversight for certain applications
- Design escalation paths for edge cases

### 🔄 Lifecycle Vigilance

- Address risks throughout the **entire lifecycle**: development, training, deployment, operation
- Not just during initial deployment

## 9. Risks & Challenges

### ⚠️ Hallucination & Misalignment

- Agents can **make mistakes** (hallucinate outputs) or misinterpret goals
- Especially dangerous when agents take **real-world actions** based on wrong conclusions
- Requires output verification and feedback loops

### 🔓 Cybersecurity Threat Surfaces

- Agents are **"digital insiders"** — if compromised, system-wide impact
- Expands attack surfaces beyond simple prompt injection
- Must anticipate insider-style attacks (intentional or unintentional)

### 🧩 Orchestration Complexity

- Multiple agents working in concert → ensuring consistent behavior is hard
- Avoiding conflicts and securing multi-agent workflows grows harder at scale
- Need formal coordination protocols

### ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Risks

- Misaligned output can create **significant liability**
- Privacy violations, bias, regulatory infractions
- Organizations can be held liable for agent errors

### 📋 Governance Gaps

- Many organizations **lack mature frameworks** for agent governance
- No clear inventories of deployed agents and their privileges
- OWASP released **Top 10 Risks for Agentic AI** in December 2025

## 10. The Developer's New Role

The role of a software developer is **not disappearing** — it's **evolving**:

### From Code Writer → Orchestrator

```
Before:                              Now:
┌──────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────────┐
│  Developer        │                │  Developer            │
│  writes code      │                │  defines goals        │
│  runs tests       │       →        │  designs workflows    │
│  debugs           │                │  reviews agent output │
│  deploys          │                │  validates quality    │
└──────────────────┘                └──────────────────────┘
```

### Skills to Develop

| Traditional Skill | Agentic Equivalent |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Writing code | Designing agent workflows |
| Debugging | Evaluating agent outputs |
| Code review | Agent output validation |
| Architecture | System-of-agents design |
| Testing | Defining quality constraints & guardrails |

### "One Pizza Teams" with AI Agents

- Small teams (2-3 humans) + AI agents as team members
- Humans set strategy, agents execute
- **The engineer who can effectively orchestrate AI agents will be 10x more productive**

> 📖 Ref: [Forbes — "From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering: Redefining SDLC"](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/08/21/from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering-redefining-sdlc-with-one-pizza-teams/)

## 11. Demo: Multi-Agent Workflow with Semantic Kernel

A .NET console application demonstrating the **Multi-Agent Collaboration** pattern:

### Three Agents Working Together

```
User Input: "Write a short article about Kubernetes"

     ┌──────────────┐
     │  Researcher   │  ← Gathers key facts and talking points
     └──────┬───────┘
            ▼
     ┌──────────────┐
     │   Writer      │  ← Drafts the article based on research
     └──────┬───────┘
            ▼
     ┌──────────────┐
     │  Reviewer     │  ← Critiques the draft, suggests improvements
     └──────┬───────┘
            ▼
     ┌──────────────┐
     │   Writer      │  ← Revises based on feedback (reflection)
     └──────────────┘
```

### Patterns Demonstrated

- ✅ **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — three specialized agents
- ✅ **Planning** — Researcher decomposes the topic
- ✅ **Reflection** — Reviewer critiques, Writer improves
- ✅ **Tool Use** — Semantic Kernel plugin architecture

```bash
cd demo/AgenticDemo
dotnet run
```
